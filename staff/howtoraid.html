    <h1>How to fuck a P2W server</h1>

    <h2>Server Finding Tactics</h2>Example code
    <p><i>from best tactics to worst</i></p>
    <ol>
        <li><h3>Server search</h3><p>Pretty good tactic if you have little time, don't want to invest a lot of effort, and want to find a semi-raidable server with relative ease. Disadvantages: Server will have a small amount of people on it and there is a high chance that all dupes will be patched, and lagging will not be very easy.</p></li>
        <li><h3>Token Logged User Farming</h3><p>Ok I know this sounds dumb, but this has been one of the most effective methods of finding P2W which are easily raidable and have lots of unpatched exploits. Step one is to join a very popular minecraft discord server. Good examples of these are the Lunar Client discord, Minecraft Discord, and any big content creator discords. Step two is to just wait.</p><p>There will always be stupid kids which have no clue how computers work, which will try to downnload shady minecraft hacked clients from the web. These shady clients will most of the time have Remote Access Trojans and other spyware, but sometimes it will have a token logger in it. If you have realised by now, it should not be a big surprise to you that its the same retards which put malware into software are the smae ones that create P2W servers. Anyway, the server owners now use automated scripts to dm advertise their server to the people in common servers with the token logged person.</p><p>Downsides: Takes a long time to get a dm advertise. Even if you are in a lot of popular minecraft servers, you will recieve a dm advertise once every fourteen days at best. But to be honest, if you go through servers slowly, the wait is worth it.</p></li>
        <li><h3>IP Port Scanning</h3><p>To be made</p></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Server Classification</h2>
    <p>As you select each option, add up the marks and classify the server at the bottom of the list</p>
    <ol>


        <li><h3>How much effort does it take to raid the server?</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>A <b>shit ton</b> of effort - 1 point</li>
                <li>A <b>lot</b> of effort - 2 points</li>
                <li>A <b>moderate</b> amount of effort - 3 points</li>
                <li>A <b>little</b> bit of effort - 4 points</li>
                <li><b>No effort</b> - 5 points</li>
            </ol>

        
        </li>

        <li><h3>How many people are affected by this raid in the server?</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>0 - 0 points</li>
                <li>0 to 20 - 1 point</li>
                <li>21 to 40 - 2 points</li>
                <li>41 to 100 - 3 points</li>
                <li>101 to 500 - 4 points</li>
                <li>501+ - 5 points</li>
            </ol>

        
        </li>

        <li><h3>How well do dupes work?</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>There are no dupes - 0 points</li>
                <li>The dupes are very inefficient (take a long time and dupe a few amount of items at a time)  - 1 point</li>
                <li>The dupes are inefficient - 2 points</li>
                <li>The dupes are not efficient, but it is still worth duping - 3 points</li>
                <li>The dupes are efficient - 4 points</li>
                <li>The dupes are very efficient (takes little time to dupe and you can dupe the items you duped making the dupiing exponential) - 5 points</li>
            </ol>

        
        </li>
